        One bright, cold fall day many years ago, I finished reading Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> for a political philosophy class. Afterward, walking through campus with my coffee, I felt thrilled and inspired, as if I'd come to the edge of something profound. I wanted to do what Huxley had done. I wanted to write a riveting novel. "A book," I thought, "that makes people think. A book that <i>moves</i> people." And so the idea took hold. A few years later I began writing what would become the Max Mayhem books. Whether they are moving, riveting, or both is up to the reader. They are four urban fantasy novels set in Portland, OR; a prequel followed by a trilogy. The prequel, <i>Lune</i> (2009), is under revision. <i>Bloodwood (2011)</i> is available on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11949572-bloodwood">Goodreads</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodwood-Chronicles-Mayhem-John-Rykken-ebook/dp/B07957SW13">Amazon</a>. <i>The Oddclock</i> (2016) is available for publication. The final book, <i>The Garden Dark</i>, is unfinished.
