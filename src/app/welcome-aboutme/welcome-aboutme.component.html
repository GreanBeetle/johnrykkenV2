        <p>Hello! I'm a programmer and writer based out of Portland, Oregon. This site houses examples of <a routerLink="code">my code</a>, my nascent tech blog 'crux', and my portfolio. As both a developer and writer, I am a fan of intellectual exploraton and continual learning. You can read about my manuscripts and writing history below.</p>
