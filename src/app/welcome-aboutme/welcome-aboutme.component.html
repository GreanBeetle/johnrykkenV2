        <p>Hi. I'm a programmer and writer based out of Portland, Oregon. I love to <a routerLink="code">write code</a>. My current area of focus is Angular and Javascript. Here are some thoughts and facts that are not necessarily all about me.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I've written three urban fantasy novels</li>
          <li>These lines are six words each</li>
          <li>"Astronaut" means "star sailor" in Greek</li>
          <li>One hobby: backpacking through alpine fields</li>
          <li>Others: running, chess, guitar, books, films</li>
          <li></li>
