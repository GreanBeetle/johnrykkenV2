        <p>Hello! I'm a programmer and writer based out of Portland, Oregon. This site houses examples of <a routerLink="code">my code</a>, my nascent tech blog 'crux', and my portfolio. As both a developer and writer, I am a fan of intellectual exploraton and continual learning. You can read more about my code, manuscripts and writing below.</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy backpacking in the mountains, playing chess and guitar, running, books, and films. I live in the Arbor Lodge neighborhood with my girlfriend, dog, and two cats.</p>
