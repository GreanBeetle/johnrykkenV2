        <p>Hello! I'm a programmer and writer based out of Portland, Oregon. As of {{ month }} {{year}}, this site is a work in progress. It will soon have examples of <a href="https://github.com/greanbeetle">my code</a> and a tech blog called Crux. For now, my <a routerLink="portfolio">portfolio is here</a>.
        <br><br>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy backpacking in the mountains, playing chess and guitar, running, books, and films. I live in the Arbor Lodge neighborhood with my girlfriend, dog, and two cats.</p>
